This is a little tool that i needed by myself.
After many copies and imports to iTunes i find that my Music folder holds 32 GB more files than there are in iTunes.
To remove these uneccessary files i need a tool wich compares the files in the music folder to the files that are known to iTunes.
This is exactly what the tool does at the moment. It compares your Music foldres content to the files listet in the iTunes Xml file.
It also displays the files found in a Window in a Table. You have than the possibility to delete the files.
And what should i say, in my case it worked like charm. Now i have 32 GB more Hard Drive space and in iTunes not a single file is missed.

So, if you have the same problem, feel free to use this tool.
